# timeline
ThymeLimne: A front-end web design template by which a developer can show a visual timeline of data on their webpages.

The core of the idea was to have a visual timeline of marked events, with the depth they appear on a webpage relative to the date attributed to them. They were accompanied with arrows.

This was originally a web design project made in Flask. It had many features unrelated to displaying timelines, like a feature that would take the name of the topic of a timeline, and do an image search and automatically generate a collage to use as a background image for a custom timeline about any topic, like the following example that built a collage from the word "chess"

<h2>TBD: A new, simpler ThymeLimne</h2>

The current plan is to reimplement ThymeLimne in Javascript, with much more simplicity, so web developers can use it as a modular feature in their own webpages. This wouldn't have a collage-maker or anything extravagant like that; it'd just be the actual 'timeline' object ready for any developer to employ.
